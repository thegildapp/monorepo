# Sapling Repository
This is a Sapling (sl) repository, not Git.

## Command Execution Rules:
- ALWAYS use MCP commands (mcp__command-runner__run_command) instead of Bash tool
- NEVER run commands with & (background processes)
- NEVER run commands that block/run in foreground (like servers, interactive commands, watch modes)
- If a blocking command is needed, use mcp__command-runner__speak to notify the user instead
- Examples of blocking commands to avoid: skaffold dev, npm run dev, server processes, interactive tools

## Version Control Commands:
- Use `sl` commands instead of `git`
- Use `sl smartlog` or `sl sl` to view commit history
- Use `sl commit` instead of `git commit`
- Use `sl push` instead of `git push`
- Use `sl status` instead of `git status`

## Sapling Workflow:
- `sl smartlog` - View commit stack and branch relationships
- `sl status` - Check working directory status
- `sl commit -m "message"` - Commit changes
- `sl amend` - Amend the current commit
- `sl rebase` - Rebase commits
- `sl push` - Push commits to remote
